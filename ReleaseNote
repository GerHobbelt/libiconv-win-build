New in 1.18:
* Many more transliterations.
* GB18030 is now an alias for GB18030:2005. A new converter for GB18030:2022
  is added. Since this encoding merely cleans up a few private-use-area
  mappings, you can continue to use the GB18030 converter, for backward
  compatibility. Its Unicode to GB18030 conversion direction has been
  enhanced, to help transitioning away from PUA code points.
* When converting from/to an EBCDIC encoding, a non-standard way of
  converting newlines can be requested
    - at the C level, by calling iconvctl with argument ICONV_SET_FROM_SURFACE
      or ICONV_SET_TO_SURFACE, or
    - from the iconv program, by setting the environment variable
      ICONV_EBCDIC_ZOS_UNIX to a non-empty value.
* Special support for z/OS: The iconv program adds a charset metadata tag to
  its output file. (Contributed by Mike Fulton.)
