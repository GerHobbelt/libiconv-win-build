mingw64_vc2022.cmd:
Used to call VC2022 first then start the MSYS2.
You can change the path and variants(mingw64/ucrt64).

mingw64_vc2022.sh:
libiconv has some headers that need to be generated by configure script.
If you download the libiconv source from git repo(not the release package), you may need run autopull.sh and autogen.sh before this.
